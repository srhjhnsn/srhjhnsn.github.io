### ***Intro***
Welcome to my website! My name is Sarah Johnson and I am an Environmental Science and Geography Graduate with a strong passion for utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to address environmental challenges. I graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in 2023 with my B.S. and a certificate in GIS. I am currently searching for a job in the field of environmental sciences, geography, GIS, or any related field.

### ***Experiences***
Throughout my academic journey, I have gained valuable practical experience that has shaped my skills and knowledge. I have taken many Earth Science courses such as Weather and Climate, Geomorphology, Severe Storms, Natural Hazards, Ecology, and Climate Change. I have also taken many GIS courses that have involved the learning and applications of GIS programs such as ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, ENVI, and RStudio. These classes have allowed me to leverage my technical skills and passion for mapping and remote sensing to analyze and interpret spatial data through advanced imaging techniques.

I have also contributed to research and data collection efforts as a Data Collector for [UMBC's section of ForestGEO](https://forestgeo.si.edu/sites/north-america/university-maryland-baltimore-county) between October 2022 and May 2023. Working alongside a dedicated team, we conducted surveys in selected forest plots, meticulously collecting data for each individual tree. Utilizing my forestry and geography skills, I helped accurately locate plot boundaries and trees, keeping detailed records on spreadsheets and maps. My attention to detail and ability to efficiently transfer data from paper spreadsheets to digital spreadsheets have been instrumental in the success of the project.

During my last 2 semesters of undergraduate studies, I worked at the UMBC GIS and Cartography Labs as a proctor, where my main role was to provide assistance and support to students in their GIS assignments during open lab hours. Being able to help students work through their GIS problems has given me a better understanding of GIS and improved my skills, notably in ArcGIS Pro.

In the summer of 2023, I interned at the [Chesapeake Conservancy](https://www.chesapeakeconservancy.org/) as a GIS intern. During this time, I used my skills in ArcGIS Pro to create maps and charts of Douglas Point Special Recreation Management Area and Meadowood Special Recreation Management Area. I also learned new stills in ArcGIS Pro, as well as how to utilize the Trimble Geo 7x, which allowed me to collect GPS data and use it in my maps. With these maps, datasets, and charts, I created an [ESRI StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e2f2457e60bf43f483bf98129f792856) to showcase my work and provide a presentation to my colleagues.

While finishing my last semester of school in Fall 2023, I was a Landsat Science Writing Intern at NASA. My main job was to write content for the [Landsat Science Website](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Whether it was articles or content for informtional areas of the site, I was able to convert technical scientific knowledge into information accessible for the public. I also created an inventory of every article previously published to seek out formatting issues using Google Sheets, which will be used to help fix the issues later on. This opportunity allowed me to utilize and strengthen my technical writing skills, which I had previously used to write technical papers and lab reports in my undergraduate studies.

Prior to my work in the field of environmental science, I gained valuable customer service experience as a Team Member at JOANN Fabrics and Crafts. Assisting customers, resolving issues, and managing online orders allowed me to refine my interpersonal skills and adapt to dynamic work environments. During the summers of 2017 and 2018, I served as a Lifeguard at my local pool, where my top priority was ensuring the safety of patrons during various aquatic activities. This role gave me a sense of responsibility, strong communication skills, and the ability to work effectively under pressure.
