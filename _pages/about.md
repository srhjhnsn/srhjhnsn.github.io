Welcome to my website! My name is Sarah Johnson and I am an Environmental Science student with a strong passion for utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to address environmental challenges. I am currently pursuing my B.S. in Environmental Science and Geography and a Certificate in GIScience at UMBC, and I am set to graduate in December 2023.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained valuable practical experience that has shaped my skills and knowledge. I have taken many Earth Science courses such as Weather and Climate, Geomorphology, Severe Storms, Natural Hazards, Ecology, and Climate Change. I have also taken many GIS courses that have involved the learning and applications of GIS programs such as ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, ENVI, and RStudio. These classes have allowed me to leverage my technical skills and passion for mapping and remote sensing to analyze and interpret spatial data through advanced imaging techniques.

I have also contributed to research and data collection efforts as a Data Collector for UMBC's ForestGEO project since October 2022. Working alongside a dedicated team, we conduct surveys in selected forest plots, meticulously collecting data for each individual tree. Utilizing my forestry and geography skills, I helped accurately locate plot boundaries and trees, keeping meticulous records on spreadsheets and maps. My attention to detail and ability to efficiently transfer data from paper spreadsheets to digital spreadsheets have been instrumental in the success of the project.

I currently work at the UMBC GIS lab as a proctor, where my main role is to provide assistance and support to students in their GIS assignments during open lab hours. Being able to help students work through their GIS problems has given me a better understanding of GIS and improved my skills specifically in ArcGIS Pro.

Prior to my work in the field of environmental science, I gained valuable customer service experience as a Team Member at JOANN Fabrics and Crafts. Assisting customers, resolving issues, and managing online orders allowed me to refine my interpersonal skills and adapt to dynamic work environments. During the summers of 2017 and 2018, I served as a Lifeguard at my local pool, where my top priority was ensuring the safety of patrons during various aquatic activities. This role instilled in me a sense of responsibility, strong communication skills, and the ability to work effectively under pressure.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. I am excited to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences, and I look forward to connecting with professionals in the field.
