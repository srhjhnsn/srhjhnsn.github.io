## **Introduction**
Over the last several decades, there has been a tremendous amount of urban growth in the Baltimore-Washington Metro area. Due to this rapid urban expansion, there has also been an increase of urban heat.

Urban heat is the heightened temperatures that cities and urban areas experience in comparison to their nearby rural areas. The difference in temperature is caused by a multitude of factors, namely the radiative and thermal properties of impervious surfaces.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the 22 counties and independent cities chosen in the Baltimore-Washington Area and quantify the change in surface temperature in relation to urban growth between 2001-2021.

## **Data and Methods**
- NLCD Land Cover (LC) Data from USGS from the following years:
  - 2001, 2021, 2001-2021 Land Cover Change Index (LCCI)
- Landsat 5 and 8 Level 2 Thermal Infrared data from the following years:
  - 2001-2003 (L5), 2021-2023 (L8)
- Google Earth Engine was used to acquire and process the Landsat Data
  - 06/01 to 09/15 dates to get maximal summer temperatures
- Composites were made for each set of data, taking the median surface temperature in Celsius
- Difference raster created from the 2001-2003 and 2021-2023 composites
- Referenced code from previous and similar work to help structure this code2.
- Zonal Statistics using NLCD LC Change Index and Mean Temperature Change to quantify change in surface temperature based on urbanization
- Anything classified as Open Water in 2021 was masked out of all calculations to avoid skewed numbers in counties bordering large bodies of water.

## **Results**

## **Discussion and Further Research**
The counties where there has been urban growth surrounding Dulles International Airport (Loudoun and Prince William) have the highest urban-related surface temperature increase (see Fig. 3). This could be due to the sheer volume of urban expansion, which could be causing a more intense Urban Heat Island effect.
Cities that were previously urbanized experienced less urban growth, however the temperature increases in those areas were still similar to counties with lots of urban growth.
Previous research shows that loss of forest land cover had a more extreme effect on heat increase5. This may prove to be true in Charles County, which is heavily forested. There is minimal hectarage of urban change with a large increase in surface temperature in the new urban developments (see Fig. 3).
A potential next step would be to find which LC changes have the most effect on surface temperature
Historically, there has been a disproportionate exposure to heat among low income communities and communities of color3. The next step in this research would be to incorporate socio-economic census data to see how urban heat as a result of urban growth has affected these communities.
