## **Intro**
GES 481: Remote Sensing of The Environment was a class I took in Spring 2023. This course went into detail on the physical side of remote sensing, delving into the electromagnetic spectrum and how light interacts with different objects and particles. We used ENVI to process mostly Landsat images for assignemnts, and sometimes used spreadsheets to organize and display remotely sensed light data. For our final project, we each chose a topic and a sensor to conduct an analysis on that topic using that remotely sensed data. I chose to research glacier retreat, and picked Kenai Fjords National Park to analyze. A lot of my techniques were based on previous research that is listed in my paper, which you can find below. I recieved a perfect score on my final project, so I am very proud of my work (:
