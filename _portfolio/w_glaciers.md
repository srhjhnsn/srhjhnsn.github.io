## **Intro**
GES 481: Remote Sensing of The Environment was a class I took in Spring 2023. This course went into detail on the physical side of remote sensing, delving into the electromagnetic spectrum and how light interacts with different objects and particles. We used ENVI to process mostly Landsat images for assignemnts, and sometimes used spreadsheets to organize and display remotely sensed light data. For our final project, we each chose a topic and a sensor to conduct an analysis on that topic using that remotely sensed data. I chose to research glacier retreat, and picked Kenai Fjords National Park to analyze. I chose to do a quantitative analysis in which I took 6 samples over 50 years with the goal of quantifying the change in glacial surface area. A lot of my techniques were based on previous research that is listed in my paper, which you can find below. I recieved a perfect score on my final project, so I am very proud of my work (:

## **Images**
To visually sumarize the change in glacier surface area, I created 2 gifs of the classification and the red band grayscale. They may not show up properly in the paper itself, so I have included them here so you can see the blatant retreat of these glaciers. More details on how I created these gifs and how I processed the Landsat images can be found in my paper.

## **Paper**
This is my research paper that goes into detail about everything that went into this study, including the previous research I used as a baseline. I hope you find my study to be interesting and eye opening to the real effects of global warming.
