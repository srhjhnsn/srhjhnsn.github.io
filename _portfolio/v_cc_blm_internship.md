## **Intro**
In the summer of 2023, I was given the opportunity to intern at the Chesapeake Conservancy. During this internship, I worked with the Conservancy and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to create maps of 2 BLM properties: Douglas Point Special Recreation Management Area in Charles County, MD, and Meadowood Special Recreation Management Area in Fairfax County, VA. My main focus was on Douglas Point, where I created several maps including a hydrography map, a Land Cover/Land Use analysis, an administrative map, and a webmap. For Meadowood, I created a simple map of the points I collected with the Trimble Geo 7X and a webmap.
