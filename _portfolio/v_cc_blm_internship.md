# **Under Construction**

## **Intro**
In the summer of 2023, I was given the opportunity to intern at the Chesapeake Conservancy. During this internship, I worked with the Conservancy and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to create maps of two BLM properties: Douglas Point Special Recreation Management Area in Charles County, MD, and Meadowood Special Recreation Management Area in Fairfax County, VA. My main focus was on Douglas Point, where I created several maps including a hydrography map, a Land Use/Land Cover analysis, an administrative map, and a webmap. For Meadowood, I created a simple map of the points I collected with the Trimble Geo 7X, which is a device used to collect geographic points, lines, and polygons.

## **Maps**
### ***Site Maps***
The first set of maps I created were site maps of Douglas Point and Meadowood. I was asked to create these as a way for me to become more familiar with the two sites, and I also created a webmap version of these, which can be found in my [Story Map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e2f2457e60bf43f483bf98129f792856). Pictured below are the deliverables of the both site maps, complete with background information of each and the regional context.

### ***Administrative Map***
Next, I created an administrative map of Douglas Point. The points and lines were created using the Trimble Geo 7x. I then created a numbering and color system to make it easy to decipher points, and also to make it more visually pleasing. The final deliverable is a two-map set (I recieved permission to make these public).

### ***Land Use/Land Cover***
The next thing I created was a Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) analysis of Douglas Point. I used [1-meter resolution LULC data from the Conservancy](https://www.chesapeakeconservancy.org/conservation-innovation-center/high-resolution-data/lulc-data-project-2022/) from 2018 to conduct my own analysis, and I used [ICLEI's Land Emissions And Removals Navigator (LEARN) Tool](https://icleiusa.org/LEARN/) to conduct a separate analysis so I could then compare the two.

The most noticable characteristic of Douglas Point is that it is around 97% forest.
