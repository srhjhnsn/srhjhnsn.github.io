## **Intro**
In the summer of 2023, I was given the opportunity to be a GIS Intern at the Chesapeake Conservancy. During this internship, I worked with the Conservancy and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to create maps of two BLM properties: Douglas Point Special Recreation Management Area in Charles County, MD, and Meadowood Special Recreation Management Area in Fairfax County, VA. My main focus was on Douglas Point, where I created several maps including a hydrography map, a Land Use/Land Cover analysis, an administrative map, and a webmap. For Meadowood, I created a draft administrative map and a webmap. For both locations, I visited them to collect points, lines, and polygons for the administrative maps using the Trimble Geo 7x. An inventory of signs and other locations that could need maintenance was created using photos and the GPS data collected. 

## **StoryMap**
As my final presentation, I created a [StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e2f2457e60bf43f483bf98129f792856) to highlight my work over the summer and present it to my colleagues. This includes most of the work I did and summarizes everything.
